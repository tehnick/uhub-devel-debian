 The orig.tar.xz is generated from upstream gzipped tarball, except it uses
 LZMA2 compression. See section get-orig-source in debian/rules file for details.
 .
 There is no constant tarball in GitHub: it is generated each time when it is
 asked. So we do not need to keep original tarball in Debian.
