Getting started guide

Start the hub in the foreground for the first time. Shut it down, by pressing CTRL+C.

  % uhub
  Thu, 05 Feb 2009 00:48:04 +0000 INFO: Starting server, listening on :::1511...

Connect to the hub using an ADC client, use the address adc://localhost:1511, or replace localhost with the correct hostname or IP address.
NOTE: It is important to use the "adc://" prefix, and the port number when using DC++ and other ADC clients.

If you modify the configuration files in /etc/uhub you will have to notify uhub by sending a HUP signal.

  % kill -HUP <pid of uhub>
Or, for the lazy people
  % killall -HUP uhub

In order to run uhub as a daemon, start it with the -f switch which will make it fork into the background.
In addition, use the -l to specify a log file instead of stdout. One can also specify a specific user and/or group, 
if one wishes to run uhub as a specific user using the -u and -g switches.

Example:
  % uhub -f -l mylog.txt -u nobody -g nogroup


If you are planning to more than 1024 users on hub, you must increase the max number of file descriptors allowed.
This limit needs to be higher than the configured max_users in uhub.conf.

In linux can add the following lines to /etc/security/limits.conf (allows for ~4000 users)
      *     soft nofile 4096
      *     hard nofile 4096

Or, you can use (as root):
  % ulimit -n 4096
